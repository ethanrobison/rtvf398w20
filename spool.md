I think this gets a lot at what's frustrating with definitions of "play"
and "games" (notwithstanding Wittgenstein's comments on the subject,
mind): they're a form of _practice_. What are you going to define
outside of that?

> We shall not look for the natural impulses and habits conditioning

I'm a little confused, thanks to the opening line, "Play is older than
culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes
human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their
playing," (1). Maybe I'm missing something.

> It is worth noting that the purely physiological act of laughing is
> exclusive to man, whilst the significant function of play is common to

Again, play is shared among all.

Interestingly, this essay has spent the first six pages or so going on
about the importance of distinguishing play from all of the other things
that are "like play."

I'm not sure that a lot of analysis has happened just yet, but okay...

> Child and animal play because they enjoy playing, and therein
> precisely lies their freedom. (8)

I really like this. It touches on something that's important about
_games_: people are supposed to enjoy them. A good game is one that
someone can enjoy, or at least that is clear that somebody (else) might
enjoy; a bad game is the opposite. Is this a nebulous answer? Sure, but
it touches on more than just the "interaction" part of things, the
"rules" part, or the "goals" part. The point of a game is to be played,
and at it's most fundamental that has something to do with enjoyment.

Grown adults playing Dungeons and Dragons don't feel the need to remind
themselves that it's all a fantasy---that goes without saying. But
Huizinga is right: that doesn't make it any less serious. Play is
serious business (or, it can be, in any case).

You don't _need_ to play, except you do.

Here we get the "magic circle" idea, but I think that the "court of
justice" (10) is the best example. It's an "ordinary room", except when
there's a person with a gavel and black robes behind the wooden lecturn
at the front. Then, it becomes something _totally_ different, where the
rules of ordinary society are (mostly) superceded.

Right, there's a certain diminishing quality from modifying the rules of
a game. It loses a stunning amount of legitimacy the second you cheat at
chess, for instance.

On a weird rant, this touches on my problem with "serious" games. In
addition to rarely being well-made games, and rarely uncovering the
"fun" parts of the activities they deign to teach (see, for example,
every game that claims to teach you how to program), they just aren't
_magical_ enough. They aren't pretending enough. Games that teach you
something by virtue of being the pedagogical point first and the
ludology second are always terribly frustrating for me, as a learner, as
a player, as a designer.

One _must_ obey the rules.

> The rules of a game are absolutely binding and allow no doubt. (11)

Implying that a game with ambiguous or contradictory rules is
poorly-constructed; that is, it isn't allowed to be a good game.

Fascinating point. We'd rather have someone mess with the rules of the
magic circle than someone who kicks the paint off the ground and breaks.

Aesthetically, maybe we should think about meta-programming,
meta-gaming, as a form of heresy. If we could make an agent that messes
with the rules of the game world, maybe we could have agents that mess
with the messers with.

And here we have a definition of a game. Pretty vague. Wittgenstein
would be proud.

I like this. It touches on why it's a good idea to give people scarves
if you want them to dance, or reverb if you want them to sing. If you
differentiate them from themselves, you can get at what it means to
"play" at being something else.

Galloway touches on this. He cites this exact passage in reference to
"diegetic operator acts":

> Diegetic operator acts are diegetic because they take place within the
> world of gameplay; they are operator acts because they are perpetrated
> by the game player rather than the game software or any outside force.
> (Gamic Action, Four Moments, 22)

That is, making a player do a particular thing is a way of, well,
getting them to partake in that exact action.

1. Play is free
2. Play is temporary
3. Play is make-believe, but serious
4. Play is order
5. Play is tense (there is uncertainty as to its outcome)

This last point is interesting. It implies that a certain outcome
activity is _fundamentally_ at odds with play. Costikyan, eat your heart
out.

1. order
2. tension
3. movement
4. change
5. solemnity
6. rhythm
7. rapture

"Ritual" is a thing that latches neatly onto play, but play comes first
and foremost. It's important to note this.

Notwithstanding the problematic takes of Huizinga (we can write it off a
little bit due to the age), let's examine the roles at play: the person
within the circle, the player, views the world as though it were the
world described in the rite, the game; contrastingly, the person
_outside_ of the circle can see the boundaries of the circle, and sees
the world as the world entire. That is, they see the playing as just
that.

The problematic takes are furthered with the statment: "Primitive, or
let us say, archaic ritual is thus sacred play, indispensable for the
well-being of the community," (26), since, after all, Huizinga himself
has been arguing that play in general is a necessary component of life.

# Values at Play

1. all societies have common values (they may not be universal)
2. games (and other art) embody those values
3. designers have the choice to be active participants in and advocates
for the value discussion

> From the misty origins of the classic Go game in Asia (3)

Okay, yet more "asians are mystical."

I don't know how I feel about the reasons to study values in games. It
feels like they're saying that games are a big deal, so we'd better
grapple with their values systems before things get out of hand.

This handwriting is utterly illegible.

These kinds of essays are always... tricky. They always want to talk
about "why games are different." But I guess it bears repeating.

I feel like this essay touches more on "values" than "at play in video
games." I know it's the theme of the essay, but I wonder if there isn't
too much time being spent on that instead of getting to what's unique
about games.

Games as value judgments, games as value statements.

> Political philosophers, ethicists, religious and secular leaders,
> teachers, parents, and peers all engage in the study, deliberation,
> definition, propagation, and communication of these values, sometimes
> explicitly in words and decress and other times through actions and
> reactions. (7)

We interface and reason about these values. The second that a breath
enters your body, it is political.

So far, this book seems to be aiming towards the responsibility of
creators, not of consumers.

Not only do pieces of technology have values embedded in them, but, "the
values expressed in technical systesm are a function of their uses as
well as their features and design," (8). This is the authors talking
about someone else's article, but it seems like this is one of their
talking points throughout the article.

A particular implication of the fact that systems embody values is that
a (conscientious) designer ought to think about what values are embedded
in their systems. As we teach intro game design students, it's often
more important to be deliberate than to be correct. That is, a student
who is thoughtful, but who comes to a problematic conclusion, is often
easier to educate than a student whose conclusions are good, but whose
thought process is absent.

Much of the arguments in this article touch on the idea that artifacts
are not designed or constructed in a vacuum---ideas and implementations
have impact on the people that use them, or beyond. Remarkably, take for
instance the fact that training a deed learning model can be extremely
electrically intensive... [RAMBLE]

"What if the game were modified to support the value of creativity
instead of destruction?" (25). I'm of two minds about this.
Rhetorically, it seems like the authors are suggesting that there's a
game to be made out of taking the mechanics of _Angry Birds_ and
adjusting them to be more... constructive. Presumably, this is a counter
to the idea that games should be solely destructive in nature, and that
they ought to feature higher-minded ideas, even while maintaining their
competitive underpinnings. I wonder if this is a pipe dream. After all,
if the goal is to "promote values to which designers, and their
surrounding societies and cultures subscribe," (26), then what value is
being captured by first destroying the pigs' structures and then
rebuilding your own? I'm not being facetious---I really do think it
bears asking. It's not enough to simply suggest that we "stop the
violence", or that we add creativity on top of the violence that we are
doing in an attempt to somehow counterbalance it. Perhaps the question
the authors are getting at is what would it look like to make a game
with similar mechanics that captures, experientially, what it means to
create? In that case, you've certainly got an interesting pitch (and the
force of entropy against you): a _BoomBlox_-style game that tasks the
player with building instead of breaking. But I'm not sure that we can
break and then build without embodying the problematic idea of
destroying other people's stuff and then putting our own, "better"
structures on top.

Anyhow, that's my nitpick---a lot of these redesigns just kind of ask
the question, "what if we also added the value X," but sometimes the
juxtaposition of two values is not the sum of its parts.

The commentary on _FarmVille_ is interesting: "The natural aspects of
the game ultimately function as a mere skin, a geographical metaphor on
a social network," (29). This touches on the A in MDA, something
something.

"[R]esearch reveals that conservative American players are likely to
interpret the games different from players with diverse political and
social affiliations," (31). I... don't like this. But I also don't want
to do both-sidesism? I don't know.

Also, I would argue that _Call of Duty_ does **not** "foster patriotic
and militaristic values," (31) but rather that it fosters those values
in politically conservative Americans. This essay struggles to include
the player of the game and their values as an equally important lens
through which the values of the game and the designers thereof express
and explain things.

The authors seem to suggest that the presence of particular values in a
game is indicative of those values being lauded by the creators, but
they mention the interpretations of _Call of Duty_ as a critique of the
US handling of the war in Iraq as contradictory to that statement. That
is, _some_ people found that _CoD_ supported the war (or, really, wars
in general), but _others_ did not. Those people played the same game,
but they had different personal context, and so they interpreted the
ludological and coupled narratalogical stances differently.

I'm not saying that designers are absolved of responsibility for being
deliberate about the values that are ostensibly embedded in their
game---in fact, I'm in wholehearted agreement with the authors vis-a-vis
the importance of bearing that responsibility as a creator. What I _am_
against is the absolution of responsibility for the player as bringing
their own values to the table. Lest we interpret commentary on the
supposed "White Genocide" within player characters as indiciative of
said problematic notion being a legitimate threat to people.

Furthermore, this essay suggests that values such as "violence" and
"destruction" when present in a game are to be lambasted, while values
such as "creation" and "nurture" are not, since those values are
ostensibly embodied in the societies at large. Of course, this goes
against the points made in the section about _CoD_, which shows
conclusively that those values are not common even within the United
States. The authors homogenize, and coincidentally they homogenize in a
way that is often acceptable within scholarly circles (that is,
politically progressive), but the homogenization is itself problematic
because of the fact that it neglects to acknowledge the nuances of the
societies that are buying these games.

Am I two ways about this? I agree with Anthropy that saying, "this isn't
a value judgment but" is probably a bunch of rhetorical nonsense to hide
the fact that what's said is indeed a value judgment. I'm also curious
how we back solve to saying, "hey, this in fact is not a game and you
need to acknowledge that you saying it's a game is at most only a small
part of it being a, you know, game." I suspect that this will be a big
part of the essay. I usually do this when I read these assignments. I
love reading.

We'll have to believe Yang, and I suppose by extension Juul, that this
is the stance that Koster is taking. The original Koster quote seems to
suggest that his argument is that the game is essentially a powerpoint
presentation. The Anthropy retort seems to be that his claims not to be
making a value judgment are 200% BS. There are definitely pieces we're
missing.

This is important vis-a-vis games as "Games", as an ontological category
to which some things are---and other things are not---assigned. On the
one hand, we might say that folx who dismiss personal games as being
non-games as not legitimizing the marginalize d by saying, "hey, this
thing which you made in fact does not count as the category you claim it
is and you therefore are not really expressing your identity, though you
clearly want to." On the other hand, we might more charitably say that
these folx have explicitly or implicitly selected for a totally
different set of criteria with respect to what makes something (a
potential "Game" in this case) an instance of the affective category in
question ("Games" at large).

Does this mean that these folx hate people who want to express their
identities? Probably not, although that is certainly possible---there
are certainly many people in the world who would seek to maintain the
dominant hegemony as it stands.. More likely, though, they've just been
selecting for a different set of criteria their whole lives, oblivious
to the fact that marginalized groups exist, and that members of this
group have a desire to express themselves.

In that case, then, we must educate the gatekeepers. Of course, this is
the job of capital-A Allies, not of the members of the marginalized
group themselves (see various articles on the Internet on why PoC
friends are not responsible for making sure their yt friends don't do
and say racist shit). Nevertheless, a big part of the tension stems may,
as mentioned above, be charitably attributed to the ignorance that comes
from living with privilege, not from malice. So, here's hoping that
Koster is not such an asshole, and instead that he merely doesn't know
what he's talking about.

"Does it point to a feature of all games by negating it?" (222). An
important part of subverting something is understanding whether or not
the creator seems aware of the fact that they have subverted it, or have
merely _done it wrong_. Of course, we have to get at what it means to do
it "wrong" or "right." So much of the hairiness of
what-is-a-game-questions is that they are so often about laying bare to
the world what we as thinking people expect from games. People are just
bound to have different sets of expectations, and it is extremely tough
to unify even slightly dissimilar sets.

"That's the reason that I keep trying to push things into that category,
just because I want that conversation to happen," (223). I like this.
Again, we call things "art" either because we're saying, "hey, you think
art has features X, Y, and Z and here is a thing which has features X,
Y, and Z, please validate"; or, of course, we're saying, "you think it
has features X, Y, and Z, and I'm here to challenge you to drop Y or add
Q."

This is curious. After all, to my knowledge there isn't some magical
masculinity to linearity; rather, I suppose most games at the time were
"linear", and games was a bit of a boys' club, so doing the opposite of
what was mainstream was considered "going against the boys." A curious
take... I should ask about it tomorrow.

"_howling dogs_ also was described with another almost-game label,"
(218). Oh, the "almost-game". I love this term insofar as it gives me
something to be angry about.

I don't know that I agree with the equating of "mechanics" with
"challenge", but I guess you can call "mechanics" rules, if you want.

I think I would summarize this piece with, "Another of _Dear Esther's_
creators, Dan Pinchbeck, argued that denying it the status of _game_
works to protect the status quo of video games," (219). So much of our
job, when we put on our game studies hats, is to understand what people
mean when they say words and make things. If the game development world
says that walking simulators are games, who are we to disagree? Even if
we instead put on our game developer hats, how are we going to argue
against the inclusion of almost-games as real, honest-to-gosh games? If
we're privileged enough to already be members of the in group, then
we're clearly not equipped to push back. If we're members of the
out-group, why are we trying to undermine our peers?

I'm not trying to make a fallacious argument here. Instead, I'm trying
to say that, if enough people say that the word "game" describes an
ontological category which incidentally includes examples of "things"
that I personally might not feel legitimately belong in that category,
what gives me powers of arbitration of such membership if not a position
of privilege?

> It has been noted many times that the word _hipster_ will always apply

This is a form of no-true-scotsman, everyone's favorite logical fallacy
(if it's not yours, then you aren't a scotsman). Almost-games,
(interactive fiction, walking simulators, &c.) can't be games, therefore
they can't push the boundaries of what it means to be a "game". Of
course, the definition of the word "game" gets at such a Wittgenstein-y
problem (of course, W-man himself uses the word "game" to talk about
"word games", but that's a whole different thing). This is a term which,
at its deepest level, resists explicit, hard definitions.

There seem to be only two things consistent in definitions of games:
someone (anyone, really) has to "play" them (whatever that means); and
they get to have an "experience" thanks to that "playing". Of course, if
they fail to have an experience, or at least a positive one, then it is
perhaps because they are big poo-poo heads and need to learn to open
their minds a little bit.

> describe your expectations for games... Now try going through the

I love this design exercise. It calls on the creator-as-artist to
double-check that they really want to include their expectations, one at
a time, in their creative process. This touches on the ideas the
Flannigan and Nissenbaum asked us to look at in their piece: design
should be deliberate, if not also "good".

> Games, by definition, include rules and goals. To make a game with

Boy, do I hate this. First of all, there are rules. There _have_ to be
rules. Just because you, the player, struggle to explain them in terms
of what you've already played, doesn't mean they aren't there. It's a
piece of _software_, of course there are rules. Even in "magic circle
terms" it still has rules. Again, you're just bad at figuring out what
they are. I don't know about the goals part, but I'm going to wager
that, since you stopped playing the game at some point, you either
decided that you didn't want to jump through the devs' hoops, or you
jumped through sufficiently many hoops that you gave yourself a gold
star and decided you'd had enough. I guess there are games where
"nothing happens", but I'm going to wager that they don't qualify as
"quasi-interactive cinema". Incidentally, that's not a bad description
of games in general. Go fuck yourself.

Also, these definitions don't include the player at all? If the player
is sitting down, looking for something to do intrinsic to interacting
with the thing, aren't they playing? At least, learning?

Another appreciable part of this essay is the thesis that making a piece
of "anti-art", at least, doing so deliberately, is itself making a piece
of art. After all, if I'm doing everything I can to subvert your
expectations as an audience member, don't I need to know your
expectations quite well?

exhibiting the piece in art contexts," (232).

Aarseth here mentions that we _could_ talk about cybertext versus
non-cybertext (here "traditional" literature?), but that wouldn't be
that useful. It would help us to understand how the two were different,
but it wouldn't necessarily help us to better understand either thing.

So this touches on a key pillar of Aarseth's argument: change the shape,
the ordering, &c., and you change the work itself. For written text,
this applies not just---trivially---at the character level, but also
higher up, on the abstracted level.

What about video games? How much are we allowed to rearrange the game's
narrative? What about the spatial world? What about the progression
mechanics? How many of these are merely a slight perturbation, and when
do they become a legitimate "shift"?

 Ah, the relationship between the thing on the page, and the spoken
 part. In particular, you rarely notice this transformation, except
 perhaps where a non-expert reader might stumble as they read a sentence
 that crosses a line boundary.

 Boom. The code is not the thing, and the thing is not the code. You
 need both of them together to get at what's happening. You are, of
 course, free to look at them separately (and this may, in fact, provide
 insight from one into the other), but that is an utterly different
 experience than, presumably, what the author was after.

"Why is the variable expression of the nonlinear text so easily
mistaken for the semantic ambiguity of the linear text?" (3). Just
because linear texts are hard to process does not mean that they are
hard to _read_. That is, _Finnegan's Wake_ may well be the _Dark Souls_
of novels, but it is not ergodic. It might take you a long to pass your
eyes over its scribbles, but that's because you have to stop often to
reason about what you've read. The reading itself happens the same way
that reading happens in _The Cat in the Hat_. At least, this is what
Aarseth is positing. QUESTION: what do we think about this?

Don't confuse the text for the thing described it, nor the process of
reading it with the experience that reading it provides. Here Aarseth
begins outlining the distinction between non-ergodic and ergodic
literature in earnest. The job of the player (or the user, or however
you'd like to call them), is to _shape_ the text.

Rob Zubek, eat your heart out. QUESTION: are readers powerless? What if
anything, does this say about the relationship between author and
reader? Are players empowered? What, if anything, does this say about
the relationship between developer (metonymically) and player?

"This is not a difference between games and literature but rather
between games and narratives," (4). Ah, the ludology vs. narratology
debate. Welcome, old friend.

"but a number of the cybertexts we shall discuss are indeed
books---printed, bound, and sold in the most traditional fashion," (9).
He does love the _I Ching_.

"Armed with a good earch engine and a digital library, any college

"Especially, I wish to challenge the recurrent practice of applying the
theories of literary criticism to a new empirical field, seemingly
without any reassessment of the terms and concepts involved," (14). What
new terms and concepts is Aarseth himself bringing to the table,
vis-a-vis cybertext?

"In the context of literature, this has led to claims that digital
technology enables readers to become authors, or at least blurs the
(supposedly political) distinction between the two, and that the reader
is allowed to create his or her own 'story' by 'interacting' with 'the
computer,'" (14). I don't know why all of those words are in quotes, but
alright, bud. Are players authors? How do we distinguish between
developers and players if players are a necessary part of the process?

That is, we need to look at new media in their own respect (although
there likely are similarities to old media, and these similarities are
often important). We need to make sure that these new media are given
the space they deserve, and that the techniques and space of the old
media remain unsullied by the unnecessary and incorrect application of
the new ideas. Something like that.

"Isn't the content of a text more important than these materialistic,
almost ergonomic, concerns?" (17). This touches on an idea that we've
kicked around in class before---what difference does, say, the
physicality of it all make? If I play on a DS4 or an Xbox One
controller, or if I use mouse and keyboard, am I still playing the same
game?

There's a Heidegger idea, that you only know a thing is a "physical
thing" when it breaks, or you don't know how to use it. There's an
embodied cognition idea that the better you get at using a tool, the
more your brain literally changes to encode that. Once you learn how to
juggle, you start to see more things as affording juggling.

"To be sure, media are far from neutral, inconsequntial carriers of
'content,' but the essentialist idea of 'the computer medium' as a
singular structure of well-defined properties of communication is just
as untenable and can be based on only a very limited understanding of
both computer applications and media theory," (19). Here, again, Aarseth
shits on the people that say, "oh, it's on a comtooter, therefore..."
QUESTION: How do we feel about software, as a broad ontological
category, as a medium insofar as it is a _thing made on computers_, as
opposed to, say, video games, which we typically also call a "medium"?
What are the differences in our affective expectations when we make (or
don't make) this distinction?

"The differences in teleological orientation---the different ways in
which the reader is invited to 'complete' a text---and the texts'
various self-manipulating devices are what the concept of cybertext is
about," (20). Typically, (that is, in a lot of the literature that I've
read), people talk about Aarseth's main point being that some texts are
"ergodic" (hard to read); here, however, he puts forth (what I think is)
his real main point, that some texts are incomplete and potentially
self-manipulating. QUESTION: ...

"If these texts redefine literature by expanding our notion of it---and
I believe that they do---then they must also redefine what is literary,
and therefore they cannot be measured by an old, unmodified aesthetics,"
(23).

(Lame) QUESTION: What metaphors and terminology do we bring from literay
studies, film studies, &c. to video games? How are these helpful
structural comparisons? How are they limiting?

Right. You can't just ask, "where are the ladies?" After all, they were
always there. Understanding the roles of marginalized folx in a context
isn't simply a matter of discovering where they were all this time.

I'm reminded of the (shocker) relevant XKCD comic about Marie Curie.
Less so recently, but certainly in the last few years there was a weird
amount of exclusionary focus on her as a pioneer of science. Of course,
she _was_ a pioneer of science. But, so were a zillion other women.
Similarly, the exclusionary focus on Williams does, as Nooney points
out, leave us with her on a pedestal.

I think the being unable to make sense part is the striking bit. What do
we do with a "girl gamer"????

Nooney eschews the idea of adding Williams to "a history of 'famous
women' in gaming", lest we trick ourselves into thinking that there are
sufficiently few women involved in gaming to warrant the construction of
such a list in the first place.

This touches on another idea from the Juul essay last week: that
"notgame" (or whatever) is a label that the "core" "gamers" demand on
the part of the people who make games that don't satisfy their
expectations. "Casual" gamers were grudgingly awarded an affective
category that had the word "game" in the title, as long as the "core"
folks could still feel that theirs was the canonical affective category.
That the two shared a remarkable amount of overlap notwithstanding---now
they had a name for the "other", and they would insist on its
categorical application.

I love that she sidesteps the "what's the first video game question"
implicitly, by calling these "playful computational experiments that
produc[e] interactions."

So, I know we're not supposed to provide summaries as our reading
response, but so far I'm really tempted. Nooney just does such a good
job of explaining things. "Who's this Roberta Williams person? Where are
all the ladies?" "Better put her on a pedestal..."

Okay, what? "That's it, folks---women peaked in the 1980s with Roberta

Yes!!! Again, as we talked about with the Juul essay, these things are
not the _default_; we _chose_ them, however inadvertantly.

In more than one way, this essay serves as a lovely counterpoint to _Who
Cares if it's a Game?_. Here, Nooney pokes at the tricky question, "who
cares if you're a gamer?" Figuring out what "counts" as legitimate in
the category of "gamers" is as much about othering as the related
question of what's legitimate in the category of "games." After all, the
policing and gatekeeping of content is perpetrated by the folks whose
identities are wrapped up in the presence or absence of particular
content within the realm of what counts.

Yup. Merely having characters with melanin does not a real person of
color add. In particular, where is their understanding of their race? A
lack of lampshading normalizes the existence of marginalized folx within
the game world (especially but not exclusively queer characters), but it
also makes it hard for us as audience members to understand to what
extent the designers were thoughtful in their choices and to what extent
they were "checking off boxes."

Ah, but "m'historical accuracy". Interestingly, I can recall a
conversation with my father about Idris Elba's portrayl of Bond, and why
that was tricky. I said it had to with Bond being canonically white,
since he (?) was a Scotsman (no black scotsman puts sugar in his
porridge). Even if Bond _were_ canonically white for some reason, why is
this such a problem? He could be canonically short, and a tall actor
could play him with no complaint. No, I think it has to do with the race
line as being uncrossable. You can twist and manipulate a person any way
you like, except for their race. That particular boundary is a tipping
point. Alas, the dumb things I said a long time.

Yeah, yeah. You can't act surprised when your audience members read into
everything you've done (deliberate or not, as we said before). The
mismatch between the extent to which a creator thinks critically about
their work and the extent to which audience members read it as
critically thought out is telling here.

It's not enough to lampshade the difficulties facing---in this

important to take note of the ways in which these conversations impact
the state of discussion and understanding.

Shout out to this game for having the character call people out. Shout

Right. Even after all of the build up, blackness is still a story prop.
Maybe not so bad as the use of black characters' lives to develop the
relationships and personalities of white ones (looking at you, _TLoU_),
but there is ultimately nothing to be gained from the black characters'
blackness.

What a take on the interface. It's the thing that brings the player and

Here, Pow outlines using "queerness" in terms of its "otherness", as a

What a fascinating take. The idea that the game isn't something to be
won, but that its ludology can nevertheless still convey a message, can
still take the player on a narratological journey, is really cool. It's
super queer! Super not normative.

It's important, I think, not to stretch the "UI does all of the work"
idea too far. After all, there's quite a lot that happens as authored
happenstances as well.

The idea here, most interestingly, is that _space_ as such is an
excellent metaphor for experience. We're very spatial, and comparing
lived experiences to the traversal of physicality is surprisingly
rewarding.

So much of emotional abuse is the constant shifting of foundations. The
pixels of the game shift. The relationship with Kaci. The understanding
that Ally has of herself as a physical, a real person.

Anyhow, there's an embodied cognition take on this essay. We have
compelling evidence to believe that we embed our minds in the
physicality around us. Fascinating. Life is more than our minds.

At the risk of excusing the abuser, it is important to remember that

self-harm. Projection is extremely powerful.

I don't know that anyone is really pulling for the widespread use of
_Doom_ as a military training tool per se, but that's alright.

It's interesting that he felt the need to do this throat-clearing, and
then went and promptly moved on. I guess the early oughts were a
different time.

Oohhh, let us dig into this.

For the closing line to a section, this statement is almost vacuous.
Admitedly, Galloway is writing for those to whom these esoteric terms
map onto something. Still, there's no reason to use jargon for jargon's
sake.

> Thus games are generally either realistic or fantastical. (72)

This touches on something that we've danced around a lot in class: what
happens when the aesthetic (visual, or otherwise) of a game is switched
out for a different one? In our conversation on queer games on Tuesday,
we poked at the idea that the same systems (the same mechanics, the same
rules, the same gameplay) as _Curtain_, but with a patently straight
couple, just wouldn't be as queer. What, then, do we say about realism
as it applies to games? If we only ask about realness vis-a-vis
aesthetic choices, what would we say about a military-themed game with
high fidelity graphics, but where the core gameplay loop is that of a
match-3 like Candy Crush? Do we need to shoot people and have their
heads explode to make a game which embodies a military ideology, as
Galloway mentions in his opening?

These hypotheticals show up often: when we teach the MDA framework to
students, we ask them about Whack-a-Mole, but with the moles replaced
with baby seals that die gruesome deaths instead of dipping back into
their holes. Koster, in his _Theory of Fun for Video Games_, mentions an
aesthetic shift to _Tetris_ in which the blocks are the corpses of a
serial killer which the player must contort into a cadaver-filled
ravine.

Admitedly, again, Galloway's eliding of the discussion of the difference
between mechanics and aesthetics---and how they both impact the player
experience---is excuseable (MDA was published in 2005, and its legacy
has been a slow burn). Nevertheless, we should ask ourselves what sorts
of things give us that military affect. Is it mechanics? Aesthetics?
Both? Do we weight one more heavily than the other?

> those that have as their central conceit the mimetic reconstruction of
> real life, and those resigned to fantasy worlds of various kinds. (72)

Uh, I guess, although I do wonder where, for instance, _Tetris_ falls in
all of this. Or, perhaps, alternate future/present/past "realistic
fiction" analogs. Furthermore, I'd push back on the idea that, say,
_SOCOM_ is necessarily about the real Navy Seals; more likely, it's
about the parts of special forces life that we as a collective audience
have ostensibly clamored for. That is, even though real-life special
forces agents spend more time learning the local dialect than they do
studying mortar-based attack tactics, only one of these gets shipped in
the final version of _SOCOM_. But, sure, _SOCOM_ is about the real Navy
Seals, and not about, say, an alternate-universe take on them.

Although, I suppose I take his later point that being "realistic", as
opposed to the opposite idea of being "not realistic", which is to say
not embodying a central subject that is a real thing. I'm going to have
to point out the law of the excluded middle here, or more specifically
its absence: it isn't as though we say that some things belong to the
category of realistic, and everything else does not.

Oh, also, The Sims doesn't take place in the real world. Just saying.
The fact that it bears on a "real" activity... Boy howdy.

This isn't much of a flex, really. _Call of Duty_ time-warped back to
1975 would have blown the DOD's pea brains and likely been classified.

Much like his last essay, Galloway spends a lot of his time in this one
saying something, and then undoing it over the next four paragraphs.

> But further, Bazin also associated neorealism with a certain type of
> narrative, not simply a certain type of form. (74)

An important acknowledgement. It isn't just the aesthetics; it's also
the thing wrapped up in them.

At the risk of over-comparing two media, this touches on what Pow meant
in their essay on how a game might be "queer."

Okay, then. I guess that's fine.

> This is one of the primary reasons why video games absolutely cannot

Much like he kicked the first essay off with a frustratingly roundabout
take, and then finished strong, Galloway here outlines the importance of
_context_ (in addition to, say, _action_) in how we play games. That is
to say, the lens through which we view the text of the game is itself
important. At the risk of sounding cheesy, let us tie it back in to
_Curtain_: what sorts of players are more likely to see _Curtain_ as
queer? What sorts of _playstyles_ are more likely to see _Curtain_ as
queer? This goes beyond anti-trans types and speedrunners looking to
check off the game's mechanical boxes; the game literally reads
differently to different readers.

God, I wish he would just reverse his paragraphs. This is a much better
take than the earlier, asinine phrasing.

So, on the one hand, I, too am loathe to over-compare media. On the
other hand, this makes it sound like Galloway is pushing the idea that
video games are unique in that the job of creators is to "inject the
[art] back into the correct social milieu," as if it weren't the dream
of many a non-games artist to ensure that their work landed correctly
with the correct people. Like, sure, video games are different than
other media for many reasons, but not along the axis of "do the artists
care about impacting the right group?"

Except, of course, it can. We know that games can have a real-life
effect on the gamer. Galloway _just_ namedropped _Toywar_.

Reading this essay feels like watching Netflix's _The Witcher_. I spend
80% of my time confused for lack of context that I'm going to get in a
few pages, after shuffling through contradictory and poorly-phrased
ramblings. I just wish Galloway would put his points in order. The man
needs to read _Clear and Simple as the Truth_.

Here Galloway finally _FINALLY_ touches on the most interesting point of
his essay, one which he circles around ad nauseum until landing on it
here and up through the conclusion. Video games are realist when they
provide their players with some commentary on their lives. His later
point, that different people experience "realism" differently, is an
insightful corollary to this.

Nevertheless, I'm still raging over this essay's structure.

What a frustrating take, if the author of the original piece is trying
to say that these games are "trivial." Not only do I disagree with
_that_ take, I also disagree with the likely take that the author would
respond with about them being, iono, evil? Like, is it bad and predatory
that a game might exist that can suck up 40 minutes of your time and
catch you off guard? Only if the designers are trying to snipe you or
steal your dough. We have _The Big Bang Theory_ and pop music and all
sorts of things that exist to be consumed. That's okay. The broader
corporate culture that surrounds it is problematic, and I freely admit
that there is a lot to be said about the proportional distribution of
casual games within the highly corporatized and predatory field.
However, I also point out that the author of the quoted piece brings up
the games themselves, not the people using them for evil. Software isn't
evil, even if we've so far only found evil uses for it. Except machine
learning for recidivism. That one might be evil.

Right, once again we use the thing as a target for our hatred, but

Oooh, yah. See the earlier... Shelley? quote about visual novels as

See Galloway's (ugh) comments on the importance of the player in the

Interesting take. I'm curious how this argument will unfold.

Sort of. We might do this at, like, the VGA gallery, though. After all,
most paintings don't have to be plugged in. If you made, like, an e-ink
video game that ran off of solar panels, I bet people might want to hang
it on their walls. Just saying.

Though, she might be (or Bogost might be, I suppose) claiming that you
can't hang a video game on a wall because to look at it isn't to act on
it, and you need to act on it for it to be a true video game.

I'm not 100% convinced by the argument that video games are a
reconceptualization of work, but this is still a spicy take.

I don't know about this, but iono why? Maybe I'm miffed by the idea that
games are necessarily "training"?

For sure. See also Wardrip-Fruin's comments on _Gone Home_.

Is this really a game studies claim? No one in the industry is going to
claim that you can get away with replacing your _Space Invaders_ ship
with a giant schlong that shoots swastikas and not have anyone comment
on the obvious problems, even if the mecahanics are the same. -\_\_\_-

I guess? Really, I'm inclined to highlight the modern approach to
clicker/incremental games (and their endless paradigm shifts), and even
_Project Highrise_, which in several reviews is compared to an
incremental game despite its substantial time to spin up.

This is perplexing me, not only because we're reaching Lauren levels of
mind-bendy, but also because I must have missed how things became
entirely about labor? Or, or something?

a "real" game.

I'm thinking in terms of my thesis (as I always am, at this point in my
life): I like that he's not trying to be prescreptive about this. I fear
that maybe I'm being to prescreptive in my discussion of social logics
games. Then again, a big part of my argument is that I'm getting at what
it means to make and to play these games. I'm not casting aspersions at
games that have claimed to be social logics games; instead, I'm trying
to pave a way for future work that wants to make that claim. I am happy
to be overridden.

So far, this has been a point-by-point comparison of "sports

mirrors traditional sports. A descriptive argument for their legitimacy.

Important! It's an ongoing conversation, not just in terms of the
legitimacy of the hobby/profession, but also in terms of what the
specifics of the activity _are_. This is, of course, why this is such an
interesting and topical subject: we're at a temporal border between
"this is clearly not a thing" and, presumably in the future, "this is
clearly a thing." Good time to be alive.

You can't come up with perfect rules. That's not how the future works.

Before the game is after the game. It isn't just the moment of
competition that plays into the material question of sports and access
(although this is certainly relevant); it's the entire history of the
competitor and their training experience.

This is a fascinating discussion. I'm inclined to think about, like,

A fascinating take on home court advantage... and on glitchiness.

Yeah, it's a tool for teaching death, but it's also... a children's toy.

Interestingly, this piece so far seems to be as much about the broader
social context of war, &c. as it does about video games and war.

I can speak at least a little to this: if I want to get funding for my
video games research, my best bet is to look for DARPA money. That is,
to do warfare research. It's not my bag, but I understand that there are
many for whom it is theirs.

I'm not sure what this means? Did I briefly lose the ability to read, or
something? Anyhow, that's a heck of a prediciton.

Uh... I don't know about that. This chapter seems a _little_ out of

This was, by accident, the first passage that I read from this chapter.
It's probably the most telling. After all, the purpose of the game isn't
to be representative of warfare in any sense. It's not super clear
_what_ it's purpose is. Maybe propoganda, maybe to fill the role of
banalization. That is, it is an artifact whose existence serves less to
convince people that war is ordinary, but more to characterize a people
who would be receptive to that sort of thing. Nah, that was a dumb
sentence to write.

I'm... not sure what this means. It sounds good enough---it's a call to
action, sort of. But, what would those conversations look and sound
like? Don't let it seem like I'm saying that just because O'Donnell
doesn't provide precise examples that she's necessarily wrong, I'm just
trying to figure out what she means is all.

Possibly, but I do feel that the idealistic "we should all share and
critically receive others' ideas" is missing a bit about the
difficulties of game development. 

Quoting Huizinga here seems disingenuous, but alright, bud.

Err, I like the next bit more: "If developers allow themselves to
maintain the existing structure where only those who have already
'figured it out' are authorized, they will continue to get more of the
same: inexperienced developers who reinvent the wheel, grow frustrated,
and leave," (165). Interestingly, so much of what I personally want to
do is to help the youth code better. These people write the most
obnoxious lines of software, and I don't blame them for it. After all,
I've written some dicey stuff before. I shouldn't act like I didn't
climb that ladder. But man, was I glad to have other people showing me
how to step. I guess this bit makes up for all the nonsense above,
insofar as it reminds us that these cultural touchstones are entrenched
because developers choose (implicitly, we hope) to leave them as such.

Please, "scrum" is not the answer. This is, however, written before the
modern shift into generally-broadcast social media posts on how to make
things. So, there's that.
