# Cybertext

# Ergodic Texts

## 

"Why is the variable expression of the nonlinear text so easily  mistaken for the semantic ambiguity of the linear text?" (3).

"The differences in teleological orientation—the different ways in which the reader is invited to 'complete' a text—and the texts' various self-manipulating devices are what the concept of cybertext is about," (20).

## 

Aarseth's definitions exclude as ergodic a novel like _Finnegan's Wake_ (truly the _Dark Souls_ of novels). On the other hand, they include as ergodic a shuffled together stack of manuscript pages for a Obama/Biden buddy cop movie script.

It isn't that the definition is wrong, since it just means what it means, but it can be _frustrating_.

# Empowerment

##

"A reader, however strongly engaged in the unfolding of a narrative, is powerless... Like a passenger on a train, he can study and interpret the shifting landscape, he may rest his eyes wherever he pleases, even release the emergency brake and step off, but he is not free to move the tracks in a different direction. He cannot have the player's pleasure of influence: 'Let"s see what happens when I do _this._' The reader's pleasure is the pleasure of the voyeur. Safe, but impotent," (4).

##

- Are readers powerless?
- Are players, by contrast, empowered?
- What does that say about the relationship between readers and authors, and players and developers?

# Perspective

##

"...like all perspectives, it will necessarily emphasize certain types of text and marginalize others," (24).

##

- We talked about marginalization on Tuesday. Which texts, historically, gget marginalized?

- Thinking self-critically, which types of types have we as a class marginalized?

# Media

##

"To be sure, media are far from neutral, inconsequntial carriers of 'content,' but the essentialist idea of 'the computer medium' as a singular structure of well-defined properties of communication is just as untenable and can be based on only a very limited understanding of both computer applications and media theory," (19). 

## 

- How do we feel about software as the "medium" of "stuff made on computers?"

- How does this contrast with video games, which we typically also call a "medium"?

# Aesthetics

##

"If these texts redefine literature by expanding our notion of it—and I believe that they do—then they must also redefine what is literary, and therefore they cannot be measured by an old, unmodified aesthetics," (23).

##

- What "old, unmodified" aesthetics do we bring to games?

- Which of these metaphors are helpful structural comparisons?

- Which are harmful?

# "Poegrams"

## 

I have never heard anyone use that term. Both examples from Nick Montfort. (Homepage: [https://nickm.com/poems/](https://nickm.com/poems/))
