	- Player can initiate, mediate, advance, &.c
	- NPCs can "afford" interaction through authored content or systematic features
- NPCs are typically unable to make decisions vis-a-vis the relationship itself
- Technical issues notwithstanding, this is still kind of dicey???
- Shift from platonic relationships to immediately romantic ones?
- Lack of awareness of player relationships with other community members??
