# Relationship Mechanics

A sketch of a thesis:

1. Games that task the player with being involved in a community (of some sort) may also provide the player with record-keeping mechanism that explicates an internal state representing the player's multiple relationships with the other members of that community.
2. However, these relationships are often shallow, uni-directional, entirely mediated by the player, and ultimatley a commodifying of what real-life relationships are; the player is encouraged to "collect 'em all", and indeed, they are the arbiters of whether or not a particular relationship is commodified.
3. Therefore, we ask how we might import our sensibilities vis-a-vis real life relationship metaphors and subsequently map those sensibilities onto the mechanical affordances of a game which maintains records of relationships.
4. We explore the implict and explicit commodification of relationships through "relationship value"-style mechanics, the one-sided nature of these relationships (with respect to agency); we also explore the ostensible mutual benefit present in these relationships, which is itself undermined by the lack of in-game awareness/choice on the part of the NPC members of the relationship/community (that is, the NPC in the relationships is clueless, but so are other NPCs vis-a-vis the relationship as a... relationship).
5. The contributions of this critical analysis are: 1) a calling-out of the trend of commodifying relationships, &c.; 2) a creation of a framework for reasoning about the bizarre operational logics of relationships in games, and 3) a mapping of the ways in which relationships are important for games to take seriously (not to be trifled with).

# Hardcore Simulation of Relationships

There is something to hang a hat on before covering the particular kind of relationship mechanics investigated in the body of the essay. Game creators often excuse problematic emobdiments of real-world ideals in their games (sexism and racism in games about war are often, for example, excused for the sake of "historical accuracy" [CITATION NEEDED?]). In the case of relationship mechanics, it may be tempting to excuse the capitalist and colonial ideals behind many examples as deriving from technical difficulties.

A motivation for "cheap" relationship mechanics is that legitimate, hardcore simulation of the relationships among intelligent beings is likely to be AI-complete; that is, human-level artificial intelligence is probably necessary for truly simulating how people socialize. Therefore, we substitute in the cheap version because of how far away the expensive version is.

We argue against this dismissal of the underlying problem by highlighting the many games which implement a physics-based operational logics (see [@wardrip2020pacman] and discussion below for an unpacking of operational logics) that is noticeably and deliberately a simulacrum of real-life physicality. In other words, game designers have been electing for years to incorporate "non-real" physics in their games, despite the impressive forward march of physics simulation fidelity. Similarly, future game designers, even when presented with the possibility of perfect fidelity AI simulation, will still choose a facsimile of socializing. They will, much like contemporary designs opt for abstractions on physics for express design purposes, opt for abstractions on socializing for the same rationales.

# Important Talking Points

## Relationship Value Mechanics

An unpacking of the kinds of "relationship value" mechanics that we want to cover in the essay. Notable examples include _Stardew Valley_ [CITE], _Persona 5_ [CITE], and _The Sims_ [CITE].

Things to cover:

- why we chose to elide dating sims and other games which explicitly cover platonic/romantic relationships as their principle aesthetic goal
- how relationships are measured within the game
- affordances for the player to modify relationship values
- "gates" and content shifts as the player's relationship with an NPC changes

## Commodifying Relationships

These kinds of relationship mechanics implicitly and explicitly encourage the player to "collect 'em all"; they drive the player towards min-maxing their relationships with NPCs, and to treat them as resources to be exploited for the benefit of the player.

Things to cover:

- the neoliberal take that "all things are resources" and how it de-humanizes the characters within these games
- the transactional nature of these relationships (esp. emphasizing the opinions that MacKinnon outlines in her essay comparing sexuality to work in a Marxist context [@mackinnon1982feminism] vis-a-vis the "taking away" of agency in a relationship)
- the affective expectations that we typically bring to relationships, romantic and platonic, and how these are warped when we explicitly provide relationship "values" which can be "adjusted" through player behavior

## Non-mutuality

The relationships that players cultivate through these mechanics are often player-directed: the player is the ultimate arbiter of their trajectory, both in short-term interactions and in long-term status such as the switch from platonic to romantic.

Things to cover:

- consent, and what it looks like in these contexts
- the "inevitable success" that Pow outlines and establishes as ultimately aesthetically heteronormative in her essay on the game _Curtain_ [@pow2018reaching]
- the lack of first-class status that relationships within these games have; that is, that NPCs are unable to reason about or comment on many or any of the relationships that the player has with other NPCs
- the lack of a "real world" nature to these relationships, not just in terms of simulation fidelity but also in terms of nodding towards the place that human socializing has in society in general (taking pages out of Russworm's essay on Blackness, and its hollow presence in games [@russworm2017dystopian])

# Analysis

The above sections set us up with an understanding of these relationship mechanics as not just shallow vis-a-vis real world relationships, but also as embodying and putting forward the ultimately neoliberal capitalist view of how things (including, disappointingly, human contact) ought to be considered capital to be invested in. We further this discussion by talking about the rhetorics of relationship transaction within these texts.

# Conclusion, &c.

Here we offer a rallying cry for creators, in the hopes that maybe they might make games which treat relationships, that is to say the foundation of socializing, with something approaching the respect they deserve.
