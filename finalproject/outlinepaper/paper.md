# Relationship Mechanics

1. games that task the player with being involved in a community (of some sort) may also provide the player with record-keeping mechanism that explicates an internal state representing the player's multiple relationships with the other members of that community
2. however, these relationships are often shallow, uni-directional, entirely mediated by the player, and ultimatley a commodifying of what real-life relationships are; the player is encouraged to "collect 'em all", and indeed, they are the arbiters of whether or not a particular relationship is commodified.
3. therefore, we ask how we might import our sensibilities vis-a-vis real life relationship metaphors and subsequently map those sensibilities onto the mechanical affordances of a game which maintains records of relationships.
4. we explore the implict and explicit commodification of relationships through "relationship value"-style mechanics, the one-sided nature of these relationships (with respect to agency); we also explore the ostensible mutual benefit present in these relationships, which is itself undermined by the lack of in-game awareness/choice on the part of the NPC members of the relationship/community (that is, the NPC in the relationships is clueless, but so are other NPCs vis-a-vis the relationship as a... relationship).
5. the contributions of this critical analysis are: 1) a calling-out of the trend of commodifying relationships, &c.; 2) a creation of a framework for reasoning about the bizarre operational logics of relationships in games, and 3) a mapping of the ways in which relationships are important for games to take seriously (not to be trifled with).

- relationship mechanics are weird
- commodification/collect 'em all of relationships with NPCs within the diegesis
- relationships themselves aren't first-class; that is, rarely if ever do characters synthesize understanding of your relationship with _other_ characters

on the other hand:
- relationships are seemingly mutually beneficial: NPCs seem to enjoy the protoganist's company as much as the player (by way of their in-game avatar) enjoys that of the NPC's
- relationships are typically mutually consensual:
