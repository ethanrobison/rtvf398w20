I'm only 80% certain that I understand what this means. Not that I don't
get that art doesn't _have_ to be any of those things; what I'm confused
about is that it seems like it should be okay for them _to_ be those
things.

This isn't griefing for the sake of making other people suffer... not

What a fascinating take on this. There's something about saying "got
your nose" while simultaneously unpacking the getting and the nose. That
is, the medium of expression here is the context of the joke over the
joke itself.

How important is two-worldsness for something to be avant-garde? It is,
after all, supposed to show that the "ordinary" way of thing might be
augmented.

I'm inclined to think of How to Do Nothing, which pushes back against
the idea of "drop out of it all." These things are situated in and among
the same contexts. The job of art, of anything __meaningful__ is to help
us to navigate those contexts and those things.

Interesting. I'm led to think about games which deliberately subvert
some or all of these. I don't know what to do with all of this, mind. I
suppose most games really _don't_ subvert these things, even a little.
There's a lot of game design philosophy that centers around "what kind
of resource chains are you going to make?" It's interesting to think,
once more, about walking simulators. Certain engine technologies
democratized their creation, and now anyone can make one. That means
that a lot of the Move + Pick Up + Open games can now elide some of the
more traditional game design ideals, like a balanced economy.
