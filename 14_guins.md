The slow and inevitable transformation into a place for people to

I'm quoting this because it's cool. Maybe there's a metaphor to be drawn
here about how video game cabinets are similar? When you look at them,
they're objects; when you play them, you are the object of their play?

See this and the above passage about the importance of games, especially
in this case game cabinets, as "designed objects" (110): someone crafted
this artifact. This makes me think, for no good or bad reason, of the
saying, "people aren't pots." There's this idea in archeology that we
think we're really good at gleaning the whole history of a society based
off of, say, their left-behind pottery. And that this is, perhaps, a
little bit off. We have no real way of knowing, to be honest. We have
only a fragment of the context behind something's "whole history," and
to pretend otherwise is to do a disservice to the people involved, and
to ourselves.

Wow. Use this, please. A powerful comment on the impermanence of these
and other artifacts.

Powerful prose yet again.

A thought: there is a not insubstantial effort to preserve the games of
yesteryear. What about the games of today, especially the not so famous
ones?

This essay is full of quotes.

A reminder that what we have "now" or even "recently" is a part of
someone's history, even if that someone is just "future us."

> California Extreme, or the Museum of the Moving Image is not the same

Oof, nice thought. Using this one, as well. There's this important idea
that the "game" is the gestalt of its experience. Playing the game in a
different context is a different game. Such is life.

> Coin-op arcade video games outside of cultural institutions are
> remains, leftovers from a bygone era. (161)

Of course, although these artifacts _could_ be moved to such
institutions, as they stand they represent a reflection of some modern
cultural context, one that, even if it doesn't explicitly index for the
mistreatment of these cabinets, at the very least makes space for their
mistreatment nevertheless. That is, to "save" such a cabinet is to erase
a contemporary culture of mistreatment. I'm not advocating for keeping
that culture around, per se, I just think it's really cool (and hard to
process, kinda) that these two things are both part of the zeitgeist
around these machines. There are people who don't give a shit, and
that's their last word on it. Cool stuff.
