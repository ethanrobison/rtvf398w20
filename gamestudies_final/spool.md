I'm thinking here about the job you have in Stardew as an ex-corporate
drone-turned farmer... whose principle goal is to deepen the
relationships that they have with other townsfolk and to assimilate into
the community.

This is interesting, in particular because we often think of video games
as "frivilous", but also because there is a tendency towards thinking of
their progress in terms of how close it gets to "objectivity" (whatever
that means). By which I mean the countless reddit posts, for instance,
that crave to make a game with a fully realized world. I'm seeking here
to argue _against_ a fully realized world. I just don't think it would
be nearly as fun as people think, even skipping over the fact that it's
both technically and philosophically impossible. What I'm getting at is
a bit of a Huizingaian argument: we "play" at least in part to be in
contrast to "non-play". Even games with deadly serious messages are,
under the hood, about playing through those messages.

Fascinating, then, that the games industry is now filled with lots of
folks who _despise_ the military. Or something like it. I'm not trying
to make up a narrative here... I'm trying to say that we can be more
than our roots, and in fact am arguing that we _should_ be more than our
roots. There are a lot of technical innovations that are possible, and
there is a lot of growth that we can undergo.

Except, of course, it _can't_. You can't catch 'em all, as it were.
There are parts of "war", parts of being in the capital-m Military, that
are willingly or necessarily elided in the process of training people
for these sorts of situations.

Yeah, there we go. Also, I want to highlight the interesting

down to just another indie studio.

The coining of the phrase.

Here the cycle continues, I suppose.

I find this steady approaching of simulation content to "real worldness"
interesting. On the one hand, there's sort of an inevitable movement
towards higher- and higher-fidelity simulacra. But there's a
simultaneous implicit/explicit eliding of the parts of war which are
less... pedagogically useful, at least with respect to combat itself.
There's this mixing of the real and simulated worlds which causes
confusion, but there isn't necessarily a mixing back, so to speak. The
simulation leaks out, but the bureaucracy and troubles of the real world
don't always leak in, you know?

The power of entertainment people to teach the big thinkers what
actually matters. Also, a further comment on the importance of skipping
over things that don't actually matter.

Far from "holistic", of course. There are, again, parts of life writ
large that are glossed over. There _have_ to be, of course, but it's
interesting that the parts that get missed are the parts that don't make
for more effective soldiering. The inclusion of civil affairs activity
doesn't reflect a more sensitive army, just an army that's interested in
winning without having to go through the messiness of shooting locals.

Deadly serious. Limited in simulation scope, of course. There's a lack
of long-term temporality; the simulation experience is super
short-sighted. Admitedly, this is fine. There's no particular reason to
simulate the social effects of, say, killing a local's cow. You can just
have your CO tell you not to do that kind of nonsense, especially since
they'd be the ones handling the negative effects anyway. It doesn't
_need_ to be perfect fidelity.

Of course, and not to be too arch about it, the military _does_ create
new Columbine's. We just bomb _other people's_ children instead of our
own.

Again, skipping conveniently over, like, the mental health of the AI
agents or what-have-you. You can't reflect _back_ onto the player.
That's okay, though, I guess.

# Stardew Valley

Relationship meters up to ten hearts... some of the villagers can be
romanced (determined exclusively by the player), some of them send gifts
or recipes to you in the mail, etc. But some of them, for instance, have
almost no content (Pam sends you recipes, but only has one event; the
Wizard lets you into his house and his dialogue changes, &c.).

In particular, it's worth noting that these 

What do Persona 5 and Stardew Valley have in common?

- move to a new town (after inciting incident)
- initially slightly unpopular (only sort of)
- tasked with "living a normal life as a normal citizen" (neither game,
  mechanically speaking, actually encourages this)
- collect-em-all relationship mechanics

Just like the games are selective and not representative, although not
quite for the same reasons, I suppose. That is, the games are at least
partially made for entertainment purposes and therefore might choose to
"opt

There is a common theme of acting as though an engineered system
captures the nuances of the real world, even among those who are well
aware that no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Or, you know,
dirt, for that matter.

We see here the importance of "correct" values judgements on the part of
the military. In choosing to include some scenarios but not others in
their simulations, they teach soldiers how the future might go. Or
something...

> History becomes a resource for this preferred, proactive, and
> instrumental orientation to a future whose decisive characteristic in
> this military technoscientific frame is as a potential threat. (16)

This is a spicy take about how we prepare to "combat" the future. We
aren't prepping to better understand our path and our trajectory
forward, except as we hope to better be able to kick the future's ass.

Here we see the point: _Doom II_ [CITE] did the job just fine, despite
having mechanics that, frankly, probably don't make a whole lot of
real-world sense. Yet it works to teach squad tactics. It works to teach
what the army wants it to teach.

And, as such, you can't talk about the modern situation of one without

I don't know that anyone is really pulling for the widespread use of
_Doom_ as a military training tool per se, but that's alright.

It's interesting that he felt the need to do this throat-clearing, and
then went and promptly moved on. I guess the early oughts were a
different time.

Oohhh, let us dig into this.

For the closing line to a section, this statement is almost vacuous.
Admitedly, Galloway is writing for those to whom these esoteric terms
map onto something. Still, there's no reason to use jargon for jargon's
sake.

> Thus games are generally either realistic or fantastical. (72)

This touches on something that we've danced around a lot in class: what
happens when the aesthetic (visual, or otherwise) of a game is switched
out for a different one? In our conversation on queer games on Tuesday,
we poked at the idea that the same systems (the same mechanics, the same
rules, the same gameplay) as _Curtain_, but with a patently straight
couple, just wouldn't be as queer. What, then, do we say about realism
as it applies to games? If we only ask about realness vis-a-vis
aesthetic choices, what would we say about a military-themed game with
high fidelity graphics, but where the core gameplay loop is that of a
match-3 like Candy Crush? Do we need to shoot people and have their
heads explode to make a game which embodies a military ideology, as
Galloway mentions in his opening?

These hypotheticals show up often: when we teach the MDA framework to
students, we ask them about Whack-a-Mole, but with the moles replaced
with baby seals that die gruesome deaths instead of dipping back into
their holes. Koster, in his _Theory of Fun for Video Games_, mentions an
aesthetic shift to _Tetris_ in which the blocks are the corpses of a
serial killer which the player must contort into a cadaver-filled
ravine.

Admitedly, again, Galloway's eliding of the discussion of the difference
between mechanics and aesthetics---and how they both impact the player
experience---is excuseable (MDA was published in 2005, and its legacy
has been a slow burn). Nevertheless, we should ask ourselves what sorts
of things give us that military affect. Is it mechanics? Aesthetics?
Both? Do we weight one more heavily than the other?

> those that have as their central conceit the mimetic reconstruction of
> real life, and those resigned to fantasy worlds of various kinds. (72)

Uh, I guess, although I do wonder where, for instance, _Tetris_ falls in
all of this. Or, perhaps, alternate future/present/past "realistic
fiction" analogs. Furthermore, I'd push back on the idea that, say,
_SOCOM_ is necessarily about the real Navy Seals; more likely, it's
about the parts of special forces life that we as a collective audience
have ostensibly clamored for. That is, even though real-life special
forces agents spend more time learning the local dialect than they do
studying mortar-based attack tactics, only one of these gets shipped in
the final version of _SOCOM_. But, sure, _SOCOM_ is about the real Navy
Seals, and not about, say, an alternate-universe take on them.

Although, I suppose I take his later point that being "realistic", as
opposed to the opposite idea of being "not realistic", which is to say
not embodying a central subject that is a real thing. I'm going to have
to point out the law of the excluded middle here, or more specifically
its absence: it isn't as though we say that some things belong to the
category of realistic, and everything else does not.

Oh, also, The Sims doesn't take place in the real world. Just saying.
The fact that it bears on a "real" activity... Boy howdy.

This isn't much of a flex, really. _Call of Duty_ time-warped back to
1975 would have blown the DOD's pea brains and likely been classified.

Much like his last essay, Galloway spends a lot of his time in this one
saying something, and then undoing it over the next four paragraphs.

An important acknowledgement. It isn't just the aesthetics; it's also
the thing wrapped up in them.

At the risk of over-comparing two media, this touches on what Pow meant
in their essay on how a game might be "queer."

Okay, then. I guess that's fine.

> This is one of the primary reasons why video games absolutely cannot

Much like he kicked the first essay off with a frustratingly roundabout
take, and then finished strong, Galloway here outlines the importance of
_context_ (in addition to, say, _action_) in how we play games. That is
to say, the lens through which we view the text of the game is itself
important. At the risk of sounding cheesy, let us tie it back in to
_Curtain_: what sorts of players are more likely to see _Curtain_ as
queer? What sorts of _playstyles_ are more likely to see _Curtain_ as
queer? This goes beyond anti-trans types and speedrunners looking to
check off the game's mechanical boxes; the game literally reads
differently to different readers.

God, I wish he would just reverse his paragraphs. This is a much better
take than the earlier, asinine phrasing.

So, on the one hand, I, too am loathe to over-compare media. On the
other hand, this makes it sound like Galloway is pushing the idea that
video games are unique in that the job of creators is to "inject the
[art] back into the correct social milieu," as if it weren't the dream
of many a non-games artist to ensure that their work landed correctly
with the correct people. Like, sure, video games are different than
other media for many reasons, but not along the axis of "do the artists
care about impacting the right group?"

Except, of course, it can. We know that games can have a real-life
effect on the gamer. Galloway _just_ namedropped _Toywar_.

Reading this essay feels like watching Netflix's _The Witcher_. I spend
80% of my time confused for lack of context that I'm going to get in a
few pages, after shuffling through contradictory and poorly-phrased
ramblings. I just wish Galloway would put his points in order. The man
needs to read _Clear and Simple as the Truth_.

Here Galloway finally _FINALLY_ touches on the most interesting point of
his essay, one which he circles around ad nauseum until landing on it
here and up through the conclusion. Video games are realist when they
provide their players with some commentary on their lives. His later
point, that different people experience "realism" differently, is an
insightful corollary to this.

Nevertheless, I'm still raging over this essay's structure.
