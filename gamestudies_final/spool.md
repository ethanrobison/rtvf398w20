It takes a lot of work, of various forms and features, to make a video
game into what it will be at the end of the day.

I'm thinking here about the job you have in Stardew as an ex-corporate
drone-turned farmer... whose principle goal is to deepen the
relationships that they have with other townsfolk and to assimilate into
the community.

This is interesting, in particular because we often think of video games
as "frivilous", but also because there is a tendency towards thinking of
their progress in terms of how close it gets to "objectivity" (whatever
that means). By which I mean the countless reddit posts, for instance,
that crave to make a game with a fully realized world. I'm seeking here
to argue _against_ a fully realized world. I just don't think it would
be nearly as fun as people think, even skipping over the fact that it's
both technically and philosophically impossible. What I'm getting at is
a bit of a Huizingaian argument: we "play" at least in part to be in
contrast to "non-play". Even games with deadly serious messages are,
under the hood, about playing through those messages.

Fascinating, then, that the games industry is now filled with lots of
folks who _despise_ the military. Or something like it. I'm not trying
to make up a narrative here... I'm trying to say that we can be more
than our roots, and in fact am arguing that we _should_ be more than our
roots. There are a lot of technical innovations that are possible, and
there is a lot of growth that we can undergo.

Time to have a subdivision of OSA, "the Fargo-Rutherford Institute for
the Study of Mech Combat."

What are the "whole new ways" of thinking that we have left to discover?

# Stardew Valley

Relationship meters up to ten hearts... some of the villagers can be
romanced (determined exclusively by the player), some of them send gifts
or recipes to you in the mail, etc. But some of them, for instance, have
almost no content (Pam sends you recipes, but only has one event; the
Wizard lets you into his house and his dialogue changes, &c.).

In particular, it's worth noting that these 

What do Persona 5 and Stardew Valley have in common?

- move to a new town (after inciting incident)
- initially slightly unpopular (only sort of)
- tasked with "living a normal life as a normal citizen" (neither game,
  mechanically speaking, actually encourages this)
- collect-em-all relationship mechanics
