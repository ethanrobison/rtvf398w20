It takes a lot of work, of various forms and features, to make a video
game into what it will be at the end of the day.

I'm thinking here about the job you have in Stardew as an ex-corporate
drone-turned farmer... whose principle goal is to deepen the
relationships that they have with other townsfolk and to assimilate into
the community.

This is interesting, in particular because we often think of video games
as "frivilous", but also because there is a tendency towards thinking of
their progress in terms of how close it gets to "objectivity" (whatever
that means). By which I mean the countless reddit posts, for instance,
that crave to make a game with a fully realized world. I'm seeking here
to argue _against_ a fully realized world. I just don't think it would
be nearly as fun as people think, even skipping over the fact that it's
both technically and philosophically impossible. What I'm getting at is
a bit of a Huizingaian argument: we "play" at least in part to be in
contrast to "non-play". Even games with deadly serious messages are,
under the hood, about playing through those messages.

Fascinating, then, that the games industry is now filled with lots of
folks who _despise_ the military. Or something like it. I'm not trying
to make up a narrative here... I'm trying to say that we can be more
than our roots, and in fact am arguing that we _should_ be more than our
roots. There are a lot of technical innovations that are possible, and
there is a lot of growth that we can undergo.

Time to have a subdivision of OSA, "the Fargo-Rutherford Institute for
the Study of Mech Combat."

What are the "whole new ways" of thinking that we have left to discover?

Simulacra to the rescue!

Except, of course, it _can't_. You can't catch 'em all, as it were.
There are parts of "war", parts of being in the capital-m Military, that
are willingly or necessarily elided in the process of training people
for these sorts of situations.

Well, and all of the other time to make it, but it's flashier, I
suppose, to phrase it like this.

Yeah, there we go. Also, I want to highlight the interesting
transformation from part of the "big green machine" at its most intense
down to just another indie studio.

The coining of the phrase.

Here the cycle continues, I suppose.

I find this steady approaching of simulation content to "real worldness"
interesting. On the one hand, there's sort of an inevitable movement
towards higher- and higher-fidelity simulacra. But there's a
simultaneous implicit/explicit eliding of the parts of war which are
less... pedagogically useful, at least with respect to combat itself.
There's this mixing of the real and simulated worlds which causes
confusion, but there isn't necessarily a mixing back, so to speak. The
simulation leaks out, but the bureaucracy and troubles of the real world
don't always leak in, you know?

The power of entertainment people to teach the big thinkers what
actually matters. Also, a further comment on the importance of skipping
over things that don't actually matter.

Games as tools, simulation as cost-cutting measures.

Far from "holistic", of course. There are, again, parts of life writ
large that are glossed over. There _have_ to be, of course, but it's
interesting that the parts that get missed are the parts that don't make
for more effective soldiering. The inclusion of civil affairs activity
doesn't reflect a more sensitive army, just an army that's interested in
winning without having to go through the messiness of shooting locals.

Very pedagogical, naturally.

Deadly serious. Limited in simulation scope, of course. There's a lack
of long-term temporality; the simulation experience is super
short-sighted. Admitedly, this is fine. There's no particular reason to
simulate the social effects of, say, killing a local's cow. You can just
have your CO tell you not to do that kind of nonsense, especially since
they'd be the ones handling the negative effects anyway. It doesn't
_need_ to be perfect fidelity.

Of course, and not to be too arch about it, the military _does_ create
new Columbine's. We just bomb _other people's_ children instead of our
own.

Again, skipping conveniently over, like, the mental health of the AI
agents or what-have-you. You can't reflect _back_ onto the player.
That's okay, though, I guess.

# Stardew Valley

Relationship meters up to ten hearts... some of the villagers can be
romanced (determined exclusively by the player), some of them send gifts
or recipes to you in the mail, etc. But some of them, for instance, have
almost no content (Pam sends you recipes, but only has one event; the
Wizard lets you into his house and his dialogue changes, &c.).

In particular, it's worth noting that these 

What do Persona 5 and Stardew Valley have in common?

- move to a new town (after inciting incident)
- initially slightly unpopular (only sort of)
- tasked with "living a normal life as a normal citizen" (neither game,
  mechanically speaking, actually encourages this)
- collect-em-all relationship mechanics
