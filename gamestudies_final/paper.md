# Abstract
[TK]

# Introduction
[TK]

1. games can't capture the entirety of the experience they provide a
   simulcrum of
2. therefore, some parts or pieces or implicitly or explicitly
   included/excluded
3. therefore, we can extract the values of the creators from the pieces
   that _are_ included
    i. note that this is similar to the ideas in F&N, although here we
    reiterate and emphasize their points, esp. vis-a-vis game
    mechanics/logics/systems
4. in particular, we note that the mapping from game ideas to "real
   stuff" _cannot_ be 1-to-1, therefore the parts that _do_ get mapped
   mean something to the audience members
    i. and it is a place of privilege or manipulation that leads to
    these decisions being elided or twisted, respectively (of course,
    these stances can easily coexist)
5. given that we can extract the values of the creators from what they
   do include, we can compare these values to 1) the publically stated
   values of the creators and insitutions that bankroll them, and 2) to
   the values that are captured throughout other parts of the game
6. more importanly, however, we can comment broadly on the kinds of
   values that these mechanics provide, and the dissonance between
   "representation" and "referent" (in particular, consider the
   relationship mechanics of Stardew, or the troubling lack of
   collateral damage in the war games that we often see)

pt ii???

1. though the military games are "games" insofar as none of the methods
   of gatekeeping---which we typically actively eschew---which we might
   like to employ enable us to reject the overwhelmingly capitalist and
   militaristic agendas they put forth by means of denying them "game"
   status; they are, quite frankly, bad games.
2. they are bad games because they do not seek to provide "fun" for the
   player, and any fun they may provide is incidental
3. of course, there are capitalist underpinnings to AAA productions as
   well, and ostensibly to independent works, too; however, they also
   provide us with experiences
    i. those experiences exist, in my opinion [argue?] to either
    deepen the perspectives we already have (that is, to shine new light
    on them), or to provide the player(s) with experiences hitherto
    unseen to them or to the world in general (in the latter case,
    through fantastical constructions, e.g.).
    ii. the commodification of these experiences on the part of AAA
    studios or smaller capitalist-leaning entities does not change the
    fact that they are still seeking to provide experiences (just
    because someone wants you to have a good time so that they can make
    money doesn't mean that they don't want you to have a good time)
4. the military, by contrast, is out to train or to recruit

- there's this disconnect: the military is giving you an experience
  as a citizen to try to recruit you, or as a soldier to try to
  train you, and you may well be having a good time, but you're
  getting wrapped up in the values system of the army during that
  process
- now, there are capitalist motivations behind some (or, arguably, all)
  professional games production
- but captitalism isn't the military

Chaz thinks I ought to look into the things that are represented by
mechanics and how those things are, in fact, not how they shake out.

1. you can't do it all
2. therefore, you are picking in choosing whether you want to or not
3. therefore, you've captured some values
4. here are the values that you've captured
    - glorifying war
    - de-bloodying war
    - military values in general (obedience, coordination, loyalty, &c.)
5. here are how those values shake out, you capitalist pigs
    - in particular, that games are generally supposed to provide us
      with values so that we might consume them (and indulge our own
      values, by accepting or rejecting those values)
    - but these games seek to indoctrinate, not to provoke reflection
    - this is different than, say, "pop" games whose goals are
      ostensibly just the consumption of values
    - it _matters_ that you set out to train people, and then sent those
      same training values on to the general public
    - it _matters_ that there are recruitment ads
    - yeah, CoD might glorify war, but it also doesn't _literally_
      include propoganda
    - a line is crossed at some point
