# Abstract
[TK]

# Introduction
[TK]

1. Games which attempt some level of realism [CITE Galloway, also
   unpack] are partial representations of a setting, or a process. They
   _cannot_ and, frankly, should not be complete representations of
   these processes.
2. Since some parts are included and others excluded from the mechanical
   representations of the game, we can and should read values into the
   implicit and explicit decisions that the developers made in creating
   the artifact.
3. Here we unpack a variety of military "games" and simulations, and
   argue that their mechanical structures are hegemonic of the
   military-entertainment complex, and do not achieve the oft-stated
   goal of a holistic training mechanism for the soldiers of tomorrow.
4. In particular, we highlight the ways in which the:
    i. gruesome
    ii. boring
    iii. bureaucratic
    iv. interpersonal
   aspects of war are deliberately elided in the popular representations
   of the military in the games created by or for the US military.
5. Finally, we unpack the values that these values themselves represent,
   and argue that we as members of a games community might consider
   games that serve these particularly militaristic purposes might be
   placed into a separate category of game, in a rare act of deliberate
   and explicit gate-keeping based off of the sorts of games that we
   find to be not representative of the values of the industry at large,
   notwithstanding its many other problems.

# Part 1

Games are simulacra of real-world or fantastical settings. They
represent realistic or impossible happenstances through their mechanics
and structure, and ultimately we play them to have experiences in other
parts of life, or of parts of our own life seen through a different
perspective.

However, it is crucial to note two things about the simulation that
games do of "the world", whether it is the real world or a world that
can never exist, such as the rather non-euclidean [TODO EXAMPLE HERE].
First, that no simulation can every perfectly capture every element of a
world.\footnote{At least, no simulation that we are capable of making
using the machines and algorithms that we currently understand. The
future is a wide open space as far as technical constructs are
concerned. I'm glad to put my equivocating in footnotes, so that I can
delete it later.} We have no means of capturing, say, the enormously
complicated turbulent movement patterns of fluids around a plane's wing.
Similarly, however, we have no means of capturing the effects of a new
form of magic on the global economy of the world of Nirn, the setting of
the Elder Scrolls series of video games [CITE].\footnote{Though we cannot
formally prove the impossibility, solving for these kinds of models
would so radically change the world (e.g., the stock market of the real
world) that life as we know it would be forever changed.}

The important thing to understand here is that there is _no_ mapping
from the game onto the real world that correctly and completely captures
the world as it operates: some things must be left out.\footnote{You can
prove this, I suppose, by thinking about how you would simulate
subatomic particles. You need at least as many subatomic particles as
there are in the real world, but almost certainly more.}

Some things are included, others are left out. This decision, whether
implicit or explicit, means that a values judgement is made about the
content of the game.

The idea that games capture values, and that those values are decided by
the developers, is unpacked at length by [CITE F&N]. We emphasize here,
however, a particular point: the mechanical affordances the game
provides are a substantial font of these values. In particular, we wish
to examine the ways in which a game's stated values---as marketed, as
perceived, as used, as a member of the ontological category of "game",
&c.---might or might not conflict with the mechanics that developers
choose to implement. We examine these conflicts in the context of
military games, themselves controversial enough at the very least for
their ambiguous status with respect to the age-old question, "what is
fun?"

# Part 2

Since a game cannot perfectly capture the totality of the experience
that it is attempting to provide, we must examine the parts which get
pruned (for they are as informative as the parts which are included).

We ask: do the pieces of the game which made it into the final cut
represent the values as stated by the game's creators? Are these pieces
in line with the values as we typically understand them, vis-a-vis those
processes?

For example, if we spend monnneeeyyy [TODO how much???] to make a game to
teach sexual assault sensitivity to officers, but that game is
ultimately a dialog tree with expensive voice acting and animation, and
completely excludes role play with humans, what have we said? [CITE the
thing from ICT].

Ultimately, we must ask what values we normally project onto the verbs
that the game affords. Is the verb "say", or "soothe", or "shoot"?

# Part 3

What, then, are the values wrapped up in these games?

First and foremost, the glorifying of war. There is implicit in a game
that takes an uncritical stance on war that war is alright. While lots
of subject matter can be approached neutrally, it is difficult to
imagine a game about large-scale armed conflict that does not, one way
or the other, take a stand. To be frank, we consider all stances to be
deliberate pushbacks against the dominant hegemony or not. While it is
possible to be neutral about certain aspects of one's game, the central
narrative conceit (such as being a soldier in the military) is not
afforded such leeway. If it is the foundation of the game, then there is
a values judgement embedded in it. In this case, being uncritical of a
particular central element is in fact an endorsement.

In fact, these games are often guilty of bauderlerizing war. Enemies die
in a single hit, and their corpses are conveniently garbage-collected by
background processes when the player moves to another part of the map.
One particularly salient quote:

> The miracle of Zekistan is that its streets are deserted and houses
> empty, apart from the ubiquitous Tangos (who all die instantaneously
> when hit). Air and artillery strikes do not hit wedding parties. There
> is no collateral damage. War is peace. [Cite Banal War 113]

There are no games that unpack the gore of armed conflict (those who are
wounded in action), or the boredom (hurry up and wait), or the
moment-to-moment socializing that happens whenever a large group of
people gather together. There is no collateral damage, unless it is part
of a scripted sequence. There is no refugee crisis. There is no holding
your squad mate's head up as he bleeds out from a shrapnel wound
(unless, of course, it is part of a scripted sequence). And, naturally,
there should not be. These artifacts are ultimately games, and this
means skipping out on certain pieces of real life. [TODO cite War Play
comment on not simulating explosions] We have already discussed the
reasons _not_ to simulate every minute detail within a simulation. It is
not unreasonable, from a technical or narrative perspective, for the
creators of these games to exclude many of these aspects of war. There
is not a good pedagogical or mechanical reason to do so. However, we
reiterate that in choosing to exclude these mechanics, the developers
are making a values statement about the kinds of things they _do_ want
to use to characterize war. 

This makes a stark contrast to the stated and implied goals of most of
this software: as training or recruitment tools for the military.
However, we have seen that these games do not provide a comprehensive
experience of the military experience: they provide a deliberately
crafted subset of it. So it cannot be that they are tools for preparing
soldiers to be soldiers top to bottom. It can only be that they are
tools for preparing soldiers to be soldiers as the US military wants
them to be, or for preparing civilians to be soldiers at the end of the
day.

Since these are values wrapped up in the games that the military
produces and endorses, we should examine what those values themselves
say. Unsurprisingly, they suggest ideas that are in line with the
military in general: troops should be well-equipped to win wars,
whatever that means. Does that mean they should have squad tactics
ironed out? Yes. Does it mean that they should have the ability to
handle internal, bureaucratic issues? Yes. And, of course, does it mean
that we, as a military institution, should have a never-ending supply of
partially brainwashed individuals willing and able to serve in the
military? Yes, yes, yes.

Likely the most frustrating part of these circumstances, from the
perspective of the games world, is how outside of games these results
ultimately are. Serious games---games whose purpose is not entertainment
but legitimate training for some external scenario, such as complicated
medical surgery---are hard-core simulations of the real-world, and their
purpose is rarely "fun". However, they are designed to expand their
player's understanding and proficiency within a particular context, and
that context is free to be mixed and matched with any other political
situation. That is, learning open heart surgery through a serious game
does not preclude one's involvement in a leftist revolutionary regime,
for instance. By contrast, games produced by the military, for the
benefit of the military, are difficult to read as anything but
shoe-horning their players into a particular mindset. There is little
room for broader interpretation on the part of the player of the
messages of these games.

This shoe-horning is especially frustrating when one considers the
purposes of games as entertainment artifacts: they are designed as an
art form which shows their player(s) an experience. If that is already
their lived experience, then hopefully it shows it to them from a
perspective they did not already understand (that is, it deepens their
understanding of themselves). If the experience is outside of their
lived experience (either by being impossible, or by being perfectly
quotidian and yet unknown to the player), then it will broaden their
understanding of the world.\footnote{Admitedly, many games do not
provide players with "experiences"---they may well be to pass the time
or provide a backdrop for competition. Here we are talking specifically
about the broad category of games whose purpose is to be delivery
mechanisms for an experience. [USE]}

For games which do deliver an experience, it is inevitable that we see
them as situated in the broader capitalist context in which the modern
world rests [CITE something?]. That is, there are no commercial games
without ulterior motives as tools for a capitalist
regime.\footnote{Though we do not hold capitalism in high regard, it is
worth noting that this is not unique to capitalism. Artifacts which
abide by the rules of the system in which they are situated are at least
in part complicit in this system, good or bad.}

A full-spectrum (nice) training simulator would, ostensibly, capture the
full spectrum of war. However, we have seen that this is not, and could
never be, the case. That is, the ostensibly holistic training program
wrapped up in this game is in fact only part of a larger, more
substantive training regime. Then we must ask which parts are being
chosen for inclusion, and which parts are being deliberately excluded
or---conveniently---elided. We see that the gruesome details are left
behind. So, too, are the elements which might contextualize the actions
of the so-called enemy.\footnote{After all, though we do not endorse the
decisions of any of these militant sides, US or otherwise, it is
presumably not a random number generator which is making decisions. In
other words, someone is justifying this war to themselves, by some means
or another. No one is doing this for the heck of it.} There is no
cultural simulation, no macroeconomic spreadsheet that determines what
the local price of produce is, nothing of the sort.

This is ultimately due to the fact that the goal of the "game" is to
provide a particular kind of experience, and the local culture is not
germane to that experience.\footnote{Interestingly, these sorts of
details are relevant to special forces (like, the real ones, not the
video game ones) and to civil affairs soldiers. Their jobs involve
providing stability and in liasing between the US military and locals.}
In other words, the US military is perfectly aware that games like [TODO
which game here?] do not provide proper training on how to "handle"
locals.\footnote{There are, of course, efforts. See, for example, the
work of [CITE Dill paper].} Instead, these more complicated and
less-easily-gamified experiences are wrapped up in role play drills and
other human-human training.

If the complicated training is left to humans to provide, what then, of
the "game" of training? We have already seen that this game provides far
less than the auspicious "perfect experience" [TODO find amusing, biting
quote here] of what warfare is like. Furthermore, we should consider the
position of these sorts of games as capital-G "Games". That is, though
it is a hackneyed question to ask, we should consider whether these
digital artifacts count as games. On the one hand, they seem to satisfy
the normative definitions of games with respect to play. People talk
about them as though they are games. They are marketed as such.

The problem arises with the motives behind the development of the games
in the first place. Ultimately, since the purpose of these pieces of
software is to better increase the army's effectiveness,\footnote{By
"effectiveness", we do not mean in terms of negotiations among US
soldiers and locals---we have already seen that these games do not touch
on the complicated social interactions between the military and its
targets---instead, we mean in terms of "neutralizing threats." This
effectiveness can come in the form of squad tactics practice [TODO cite
that one game], avoiding bureaucratic troubles [TODO reference sexual
assault training for officers], or merely providing warm bodies for the
army [TODO cite America's Army].} we should call into question whether
we, as community members, want to award these the title of "game".
