# Abstract
[TK]

# Introduction
[TK]

1. games can't capture the entirety of the experience they provide a
  simulcrum of
2. therefore, some parts or pieces or implicitly or explicitly
   included/excluded
3. therefore, we can extract the values of the creators from the pieces
   that _are_ included
    i. note that this is similar to the ideas in F&N, although here we 
    reiterate and emphasize their points, esp. vis-a-vis game
    mechanics/logics/systems
4. in particular, we note that the mapping from game ideas to "real
   stuff" _cannot_ be 1-to-1, therefore the parts that _do_ get mapped
   mean something to the audience members
   i. and it is a place of privilege or manipulation that leads to these
   decisions being elided or twisted, respectively (of course, these
   stances can easily coexist)
